# 🏥 Health Insurance Cost Prediction & Risk Analysis Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **predictive and analytical system** that helps health insurance providers to:

- Estimate medical claim costs for policyholders based on demographic and lifestyle factors.  
- Identify the most influential cost drivers (e.g., age, BMI, smoking).  
- Forecast future claim costs to improve pricing and profitability.  
- Visualize trends and insights through an interactive dashboard.
